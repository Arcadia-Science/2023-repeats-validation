# Repeat Expansions Validations

This repository validates examples found in the `2023-repeats-profiling` pilot project by mapping RNASeq experiments to species that repeat expansion homologs were identified in. The code in this repository is associated with the pub [Repeat expansions associated with human disease are present in diverse organisms](https://doi.org/10.57844/arcadia-e367-8b55).

Instructions for running the workflow are in `transcriptome-workflow/`, and other scripts and metadata are for organizing the metadata for the RNAseq accessions.
